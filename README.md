## Proposal
Are you a busy trainer with a software engineering job? PokeCare allows you to send your pokemon to the daycare and
 then you can go to work stress-free knowing your pokemon are well taken care of! Our daycares take in pokemon,
 train those hectic pokemon for you, and allow them to create bonds with each other.
 This allows you as a trainer stay focused on those coding challenges so you and your pokemon can succeed by then end of the day!
